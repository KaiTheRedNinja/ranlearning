Teacher Ran was very willing to help us and arranged extra tutoring sessions before the exam. She was also very patient in explaining my questions and gave me detailed advice. Her teaching materials were rich in content and covered the key points of the exam, helping me revise more efficiently. Every lesson was very substantial, not only improving my language skills but also boosting my confidence in learning Chinese. Thanks to the teacher's help, I ended up getting a 7 on my IB exam! I am very grateful for her careful guidance and support!",

Her notes are very detailed and useful and she often organises extra classes for us, especially to brush up our Chinese oral skills. These lessons are extremely effective as my Chinese oral saw improvement quickly and I was more confident in my writing skills as well. I am proud to say that under her guidance, I managed to improve from a B4 to an A2 in my GCE O-level Higher Chinese after joining her classes for a short period of 6 months. I would highly recommend 冉⽼师's classes to any parents who want to send their kids to a tuition center that is effective and can bring immediate change to their child's results."
